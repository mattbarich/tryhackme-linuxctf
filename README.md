# tryhackme-linuxctf
Hello there!!

This is my first repository write up of the linuxctf from tryhackme.com.

About this CTF:
  In this CTF I will be stepping through each task given by try hack me 
  and showing my process of obtaining each flag.
  
  **This is a very easy CTF to finish as it is rated easy on the website.

About tryhackme.com:
  Tryhackme is a Ethical hacking website that allows users to improve and 
  learn about the ethical hacking process. I found this website to very
  similar to other ethical hacking CTFs but personally enjoyed it more!!
  
  I hope you find this write up useful in your own tryhackme adventures!!
